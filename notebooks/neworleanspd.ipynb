    "The Field Interview Card data is sourced from [data.nola.gov](https://data.nola.gov/Public-Safety-and-Preparedness/Stop-and-Search-Field-Interviews-/kitu-f4uy), which is an online third-party resource for data and metrics about the city of New Orleans. This data was originally published by the New Orleans Police Department, and was most recently loaded here on **February 24th, 2023**. This data contains a unique primary key, an NOPD reference item, the district and zone of the interview, the officer's district assignment, a description of the stop, the actions taken, information about vehicles involved if the interview was the result of an incident involving vehicles, information about the subject, and location. Note that the locations involved have been anonymized - the data only contains fidelity to a zip code and a block, and is maintained that way out of privacy concerns. Interview data was also available dating back to at least 1993, albeit sparsely, but this project only focuses on interviews conducted on or after January 1st, 2022.\n",

    "These are all the counts of missing data ([numpy NaN objects](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/constants.html)) prseent in the field interview cards data set. Some columns are inherently non-sparse, such as teh primary key `FieldInterviewID` or `NOPD_Item`, as well as the boolean attribute `SubjectHasPhotoID` in which the variable is marked as False unless shown to be otherwise true. Notably, the information about vehicles involved tends to be sparse, but this is most likely accounted for in incidents not involving vehicles at all, and so presents no logical issues. There are various reasons why subject information could be missing, such as officer error, indeterminate attributes (low lighting, incident was too short to collect definitive attributes, etc.,), lack of collection (ID or driver's licence was never needed to be checked), or anonymization out of safety concerns. We do not assert that the sparsity of these attributes is independent of the attributes of the subjects themselves - `SubjectRace` is one of the least sparse attributes in the data set, as well as `SubjectGender`, which can be determined visually as opposed to attributes like `SubjectAge` which requires some official record examination to collect. Therefore, these sparse observations will not be dropped, but will be accounted for separately."
